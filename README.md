# LabDocumentSystem
## Description
Inspired by the disastrous past experiences of scientific research of the group members, LabDocumentSystem aims to develop a web application using MEAN Stack to help scientists managing their lab records efficiently. Hopefully, this app will help them to waste less time before realizing the cruel reality and turning to other jobs.
